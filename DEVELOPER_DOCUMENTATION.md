üìò Secure Auth API Documentation
Base URL: http://localhost:5000
üí° This is a secure two-step login system using email-password and OTP verification. Tokens are stored in cookies for secure session management.
üîê Authentication Routes
1. Register a New User
URL: /auth/register
Method: POST
Description: Registers a user with email and password.
Request Body:
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "yourSecurePassword"
}
Responses:
201 Created: User registered successfully
409 Conflict: User already exists
2. Login ‚Äì Step 1 (Email & Password)
URL: /auth/login
Method: POST
Description: Validates email & password. If correct, sends OTP to email.
Request Body:
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "yourSecurePassword"
}
Responses:
200 OK: OTP sent to email
401 Unauthorized: Incorrect password
404 Not Found: User does not exist
Frontend should now navigate to the OTP input screen.
3. Login ‚Äì Step 2 (OTP Verification)
URL: /auth/verify-otp
Method: POST
Description: Verifies OTP and logs user in by setting secure cookies.
Request Body:
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "otp": "123456"
}
Responses:
200 OK: Logged in successfully (cookies set: accessToken, refreshToken)
401 Unauthorized: OTP invalid or not generated
Frontend must send this request immediately after login step 1. The cookies are HTTP-only, so no need to manually handle tokens on the frontend.
4. Refresh Access Token
URL: /auth/refresh-token
Method: POST
Description: Refreshes the access token using the refresh token cookie.
Request Headers: Cookies must include refreshToken.
Responses:
200 OK: New access token set as cookie
401 Unauthorized: No token found
403 Forbidden: Invalid or expired token
Used to keep the user session alive without logging in again.
5. Logout
URL: /auth/logout
Method: POST
Description: Clears both access and refresh token cookies.
Responses:
200 OK: Logged out successfully
üç™ Cookies Used
Cookie Name	Type	Expires In	Purpose
accessToken	HTTP-only	15 minutes	Authenticated API access
refreshToken	HTTP-only	7 days	Session persistence
‚úÖ All cookies are HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite=Strict.
‚ö†Ô∏è Security & Limitations
Rate limiting: Max 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
OTP expires in 5 minutes (handled client-side)
In-memory storage (for demo): Replace with DB (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) in production
üì¶ Technologies Used
Express.js ‚Äì Server framework
bcrypt ‚Äì Password & OTP hashing
jsonwebtoken ‚Äì Token creation and verification
Resend API ‚Äì Email delivery (https://resend.com)
Cookies ‚Äì Secure session management
Rate Limiting ‚Äì Prevent brute force attacks
üîß Frontend Developer Checklist
Login flow:
Send credentials to /auth/login
Show OTP screen after successful response
Send OTP to /auth/verify-otp
Use withCredentials: true in all fetch/axios calls
Use cookie-based authentication (no need to store JWT manually)
Call /auth/refresh-token periodically (e.g., every 10 minutes or on 401)
Handle /auth/logout for signout

Important Notes for Frontend Integration

All POST routes expect CSRF tokens in headers/cookies (use /csrf-token endpoint to fetch fresh token).
Authentication tokens are stored in httpOnly cookies: accessToken (short-lived) and refreshToken (long-lived).
On login success, cookies are set automatically via backend response.
Use accessToken cookie for authenticated GET requests like /auth/me.
Rate limiting applied on OTP verification to prevent brute-force attacks.
Password strength and validation happen on backend; frontend can add similar validation for better UX.
